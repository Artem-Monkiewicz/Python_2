          Hello devs, if you are looking to learn new tools and technologies in
          2023 then you should consider learning Docker and Kubernetes, two of
          the most essential tools for creating and managing containers in this
          era of Microservices and Cloud Computing.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          With the rise of Microservices and Cloud Computing, Docker and
          Kubernetes has become and essential tool for Software developer and
          now its imperative for many of us to learn them to succeed as Software
          developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to learn Docker and Kubernetes, also known as K8s then you
          are already made a great decision. Earlier, I have shared the best
          free Docker courses and free kubernetes courses and you can check them
          to start your journey. If you are still on fence to to learn Docker

      <h2>Why Every Developer Should Learn Docker and Kubernetes in 2023?</h2>
      <p>
        Now that you know what does Docker and Kubernetes offers to software
        developers, it makes it easy to understand why every programmer or
        software developer should learn Kubernetes. The main reason is the
        increased adoption of the Cloud where Kubernetes plays an important
        role.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every few years, there is a major trend in the tech world that shapes
        the landscapes of the industry. In the past, these have been things like
        Concurrency and cloud computing. Then a wave of Blockchain, Data
        Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence comes. Well, they
        are still here but we'll not discuss those in this article.
